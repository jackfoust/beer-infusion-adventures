# Indian Brown Ale
* 10 minutes with Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee beans from [Appalachian Coffee Roasters](http://appalachiancoffeeroasters.com/) about 50 beans. More smell of coffee than taste. Should have done 15 minutes.

* 5 minutes with sweetened Coccunut shavings. Came out pretty tasty and with carbonation.
